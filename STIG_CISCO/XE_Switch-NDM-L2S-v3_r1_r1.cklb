An unknown DHCP server on the network on an untrusted port is called a spurious DHCP server, any device (PC, Wireless Access Point) that is loaded with DHCP server enabled. The DHCP snooping feature determines whether traffic sources are trusted or untrusted. The potential exists for a spurious DHCP server to respond to DHCPDISCOVER messages before the real server has time to respond. DHCP snooping allows switches on the network to trust the port a DHCP server is connected to and not trust the other ports.\n\nThe DHCP snooping feature validates DHCP messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid messages as well as rate-limits DHCP traffic from trusted and untrusted sources.

Passwords must be protected at all times; using a strong one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt is the standard method for providing a means to validate a password without having to store the actual password.\n\nPerformance and time required to access are factors that must be considered, and the one way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security. If passwords are stored in clear text, they can be plainly read and easily compromised.\n\nIn many instances, verifying the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the stored hash.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-110541","V-101437"],"ccis":["CCI-004062","CCI-004910"],"reference_identifier":"4067","uuid":"440db8d7-d4be-4a3e-8d12-2221c4b3546b","stig_uuid":"71d3cef8-4b5d-407a-aa63-9d564a7165df","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-220544","group_tree":[{"id":"V-220544","title":"SRG-APP-000190-NDM-000267","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-220544","severity":"high","group_title":"The Cisco switch must be configured to terminate all network connections associated with device management after five minutes of inactivity.","rule_id_src":"SV-220544r961068_rule","rule_id":"SV-220544r961068","rule_version":"CISC-ND-000720","rule_title":"The Cisco switch must be configured to terminate all network connections associated with device management after five minutes of inactivity.","fix_text":"Set the idle timeout value to five minutes or less on all configured login classes as shown in the example below:\r\n\r\nSW1(config)#line vty 0 1\r\nSW1(config-line)#exec-timeout 5 0\r\nSW1(config-line)#exit\r\nSW1(config)#line con 0\r\nSW1(config-line)#exec-timeout 5 0\r\nSW1(config-line)#exit\r\nSW2(config)#ip http timeout-policy idle 300 life nnnn requests nn","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Review the Cisco switch configuration to verify that all network connections associated with a device management have an idle timeout value set to five minutes or less as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\nip http secure-server\r\nip http timeout-policy idle 300 life nnnn requests nn\r\n…\r\n…\r\n…\r\nline con 0\r\n exec-timeout 5 0\r\nline vty 0 1\r\n exec-timeout 5 0\r\n\r\nIf the Cisco switch is not configured to terminate all network connections associated with a device management after five minutes of inactivity, this is a finding.","check_content_ref":{"href":"Cisco_IOS_XE_Switch_NDM_STIG.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"Unclassified","discussion":"Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended.
