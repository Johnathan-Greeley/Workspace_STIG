These devices include the switches, routers, and servers in the network. Host ports and unknown DHCP servers are considered untrusted sources. An unknown DHCP server on the network on an untrusted port is called a spurious DHCP server, any device (PC, Wireless Access Point) that is loaded with DHCP server enabled. The DHCP snooping feature determines whether traffic sources are trusted or untrusted. The potential exists for a spurious DHCP server to respond to DHCPDISCOVER messages before the real server has time to respond. DHCP snooping allows switches on the network to trust the port a DHCP server is connected to and not trust the other ports.\n\nThe DHCP snooping feature validates DHCP messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid messages as well as rate-limits DHCP traffic from trusted and untrusted sources.

The following is an example configuration: \n\ncontrol-plane \nservice-policy input CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY \n\nNote: Control Plane Protection (CPPr) can be used to filter as well as police control plane traffic destined to the RP.

Hence, a separate policy-map could be configured for each traffic category.\n\nIf the Cisco switch is not configured to protect against known types of DoS attacks by employing organization-defined security safeguards, this is a finding.","check_content_ref":{"href":"Cisco_IOS-XE_Switch_RTR_STIG.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"Unclassified","discussion":"The Route Processor (RP) is critical to all network operations because it is the component used to build all forwarding paths for the data plane via control plane processes. It is also instrumental with ongoing network management functions that keep the switches and links available for providing network services. Any disruption to the RP or the control and management planes can result in mission-critical network outages.\n\nA DoS attack targeting the RP can result in excessive CPU and memory utilization. To maintain network stability and RP security, the switch must be able to handle specific control plane and management plane traffic that is destined to the RP. In the past, one method of filtering was to use ingress filters on forwarding interfaces to filter both forwarding path and receiving path traffic. However, this method does not scale well as the number of interfaces grows and the size of the ingress filters grows. Control plane policing increases the security of switches and multilayer switches by protecting the RP from unnecessary or malicious traffic. Filtering and rate limiting the traffic flow of control plane packets can be implemented to protect switches against reconnaissance and DoS attacks, allowing the control plane to maintain packet forwarding and protocol states despite an attack or heavy load on the switch or multilayer switch.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-110811","V-101707"],"ccis":["CCI-002385"],"reference_identifier":"4074","uuid":"fd8b6bcb-6862-465b-9e72-698ea7e53a8c","stig_uuid":"685d2ac1-f2e9-4b7c-9d3a-77433ab69b08","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-220996","group_tree":[{"id":"V-220996","title":"SRG-NET-000205-RTR-000001","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-220996","severity":"high","group_title":"The Cisco switch must be configured to restrict traffic destined to itself.","rule_id_src":"SV-220996r622190_rule","rule_id":"SV-220996r622190","rule_version":"CISC-RT-000130","rule_title":"The Cisco switch must be configured to restrict traffic destined to itself.","fix_text":"Step 1: Configure the ACL for any external interfaces as shown in the example below:\n\nSW1(config)#ip access-list extended EXTERNAL_ACL\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit tcp host x.11.1.1 eq bgp host x.11.1.2 \nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit tcp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 eq bgp\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit icmp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 echo\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit icmp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 echo-reply\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#deny ip any host x.11.1.1 log-input\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit …\n…\n…\n…\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#deny ip any any log-input\n\nStep 2: Configure the ACL for any external interfaces as shown in the example below:\n\nSW1(config)#ip access-list extended INTERNAL_ACL\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit ospf host 10.1.12.1 host 10.1.12.2\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit tcp 10.2.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.12.2 eq 22\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit tcp 10.2.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.12.2 eq tacacs\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit udp 10.2.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.12.2 eq snmp\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit udp 10.2.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.12.2 eq ntp\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#deny ip any host 10.1.12.2 log-input\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit …\n…\n…\n…\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#permit ip any any log-input\nSW1(config-ext-nacl)#exit\n\nNote: Best practice is to configure the ACL statements relative to traffic destined to the switch first followed by ACL statements for transit traffic.\n\nStep 3: Apply the ACLs to the appropriate interface as shown in the example below:\n\nSW1(config)#int g0/2\nSW1(config-if)#ip access-group EXTERNAL_ACL in\nSW1(config)#int g0/3\nSW1(config-if)#ip access-group INTERNAL_ACL in","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Review the external and internal ACLs to verify that the switch is configured to only allow specific management and control plane traffic from specific sources destined to itself.\n\nStep 1: Verify ACLs has been configured as shown in the example below that matches expected control plane and management plane traffic.

The directed broadcast is routed through the network as a unicast packet until it arrives at the target subnet, where it is converted into a link-layer broadcast. Because of the nature of the IP addressing architecture, only the last switch in the chain, which is connected directly to the target subnet, can conclusively identify a directed broadcast.\n\nIP directed broadcasts are used in the extremely common and popular smurf, or denial-of-service (DoS), attacks. In a smurf attack, the attacker sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests from a falsified source address to a directed broadcast address, causing all the hosts on the target subnet to send replies to the falsified source. By sending a continuous stream of such requests, the attacker can create a much larger stream of replies, which can completely inundate the host whose address is being falsified. This service should be disabled on all interfaces when not needed to prevent smurf and DoS attacks.\n\nDirected broadcast can be enabled on internal facing interfaces to support services such as Wake-On-LAN. Case scenario may also include support for legacy applications where the content server and the clients do not support multicast. The content servers send streaming data using UDP broadcast. Used in conjunction with the IP multicast helper-map feature, broadcast data can be sent across a multicast topology.

This overrides the switch's normal routing procedures used to control the specific paths of network traffic. It is normally used for traffic engineering but can also be used to meet security requirements; for example, traffic that is not allowed can be routed to the Null0 or discard interface.

Initiated by an attacker or a misconfigured switch, prefix de-aggregation occurs when the announcement of a large prefix is fragmented into a collection of smaller prefix announcements.\n\nIn 1997, misconfigured switches in the Florida Internet Exchange network (AS7007) de-aggregated every prefix in their routing table and started advertising the first /24 block of each of these prefixes as their own. Faced with this additional burden, the internal switches became overloaded and crashed repeatedly. This caused prefixes advertised by these switches to disappear from routing tables and reappear when the switches came back online. As the switches came back after crashing, they were flooded with the routing table information by their neighbors. The flood of information would again overwhelm the switches and cause them to crash. This process of route flapping served to destabilize not only the surrounding network but also the entire Internet. Switches trying to reach those addresses would choose the smaller, more specific /24 blocks first.

RSVP-TE is also used to enable MPLS Fast Reroute, a network restoration mechanism that will reroute traffic onto a backup LSP in case of a node or link failure along the primary path. When there is a disruption in the MPLS core, such as a link flap or switch reboot, the result is a significant amount of RSVP signaling, such as \"PathErr\" and \"ResvErr\" messages that need to be sent for every LSP using that link.\n\nWhen RSVP messages are sent out, they are sent either hop by hop or with the switch alert bit set in the IP header. This means that every switch along the path must examine the packet to determine if additional processing is required for these RSVP messages. If there is enough signaling traffic in the network, it is possible for an interface to receive more packets for its input queue than it can hold, resulting in dropped RSVP messages and hence slower RSVP convergence. Increasing the size of the interface input queue can help prevent dropping packets; however, there is still the risk of having a burst of signaling traffic that can fill the queue. Solutions to mitigate this risk are RSVP message pacing or refresh reduction to control the rate at which RSVP messages are sent.
